# Video Screensaver
A Windows screensaver that plays videos(with or without sound) and images.

This project is active thanks to the effort of [Michael Barnathan](https://sourceforge.net/u/metasquares/profile/) and Chris Lott.
I forked it from https://github.com/chrislott/Videosaver who copied it from SourceForge(https://sourceforge.net/projects/videosaver/).

## Requirements
I am using this project with Visual Studio Community 2017, but I assume that it would work with all intermediate versions as well.

## Other Sources
Currently adding new features.
